Rename Objects to Elements.

Rename array to slice.

Rethink color palette.

Something in image drawing routines is broken, not handling it well
when image's rectangle.min != ZP.

Prevent server from locking up, See 9pqueue(2).  Probably need an
independent queue for every blocking file.

Handle OTRUNC.

Fix crashes when you write into files.

Simplify file handling: add Array for text to objects, and use
standard arrayread/arraywrite.  Copy array back to global text buffer
on destroyfid.  Do the same for fonts.

Separate functions for open and destroyfid, the way read/write works now.
